I made a old school arcade game in a 80s neon style. 
 
## What does this project have?
* A loading screen
* You can insert a coin just like a arcade game .
* Control the car
* Alot of animations 
* Style changes based on users prefers color scheme and time.

## What did you learn

* @Keyframes 
* Transform: perspective 
* nth-of-type (already used nth-child )
* prefers: dark mode/ reduce motion 

* Improving Linear Gradient


## Contexts: Dark mode (prefers-color-scheme)

The prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Dark Mode

How to change colors/theme on your pc?
* Windows: Settings > Personalization > Colors > Choose your color > Dark or light
* Mac:  General settings > Appearance > Dark or light

## Restriction
* Responsive without media queries (only the musicbars are litte weird on mobile)
* Design responds to time (day = lightmode - night - darkmode)

## Wishlist
* Make the soundwave 100% responsive 
* Change car colors if the user press boost button or go left/right
* Make the sun/planet turn
